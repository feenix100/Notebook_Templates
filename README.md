## Template Structure

Each template covers different topics in college algebra. Here is the structure and explanation of the sections included:

### 1. Basic Algebraic Operations

Perform basic algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of algebraic expressions.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Addition: $a + b$
- Subtraction: $a - b$
- Multiplication: $a \times b$ or $a \cdot b$
- Division: $\frac{a}{b}$
- Exponentiation: $a^b$
- Square Root: $\sqrt{a}$
- Fraction: $\frac{a}{b}$
- Parentheses: $(a + b)$

**Example: Simplify an Expression**
Simplify the following expression: $(2x + 3) - (x - 5)$

**Solution:**
To simplify, distribute the negative sign and combine like terms:
$$(2x + 3) - (x - 5) = 2x + 3 - x + 5 = x + 8$$

### 2. Solving Equations and Inequalities

Solve linear, quadratic, and higher-order equations, as well as inequalities.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Linear Equation: $ax + b = c$
- Quadratic Equation: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
- Inequality: $x > 5$ or $x \leq 10$
- Quadratic Formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**Example: Solve a Quadratic Equation**
Solve the equation: $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$

**Solution:**
Factor the quadratic equation:
$$x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0$$
Set each factor to zero:
$$x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0$$
Thus, $x = 1$ or $x = 3$.

### 3. Functions and Their Properties

Explore functions, their domains, ranges, and key properties.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Function Notation: $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2$
- Domain and Range: For $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, Domain: $x \neq 0$, Range: $y \neq 0$
- Function Properties: $f(0)$, $f'(x)$, $f''(x)$

**Example: Define a Function and Find Its Domain**
Define the function $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2$ and find its domain.

**Solution:**
The domain of a polynomial function is all real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$.

### 4. Polynomial and Rational Functions

Work with polynomial and rational functions, including their graphs and asymptotes.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Polynomial Function: $p(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1$
- Rational Function: $r(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 1}$
- Asymptote: $y = \frac{1}{x}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$

**Example: Find the Roots of a Polynomial**
Find the roots of the polynomial $x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$.

**Solution:**
Factor the polynomial:
$$x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)$$
Set each factor to zero:
$$x - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0$$
Thus, the roots are $x = 1$, $x = 2$, and $x = 3$.

### 5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Study exponential and logarithmic functions and their applications.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Exponential Function: $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$
- Logarithmic Function: $f(x) = \log_b(x)$ or $f(x) = \ln(x)$
- Exponential Growth/Decay: $y = y_0 e^{kt}$

**Example: Solve an Exponential Equation**
Solve the equation $e^x = 5$.

**Solution:**
To solve for $x$, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
$$x = \ln(5)$$

### 6. Systems of Equations and Matrices

Solve systems of equations using matrix representation and row reduction.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- System of Equations: $\begin{cases} ax + by = c \\ dx + ey = f \end{cases}$
- Matrix Representation: $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ d & e \end{pmatrix}$
- Row Reduction: $\mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$

**Example: Solve a System of Equations**
Solve the system: $\begin{cases} 2x + 3y = 5 \\ x - y = 2 \end{cases}$

**Solution:**
Use matrix representation and row reduction to find the solution.

### 7. Sequences, Series, and Probability

Work with arithmetic and geometric sequences, series, and basic probability.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Arithmetic Sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
- Geometric Sequence: $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}$
- Series: $S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$
- Probability: $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$

**Example: Find the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**
Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the arithmetic series where $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 3$.

**Solution:**
Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
$$S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} (2 + (2 + (10-1) \cdot 3)) = 5 \cdot (2 + 29) = 5 \cdot 31 = 155$$

### 8. Slope of a Line

Calculate the slope of a line using the slope formula.

**LaTeX Examples:**
- Slope Formula: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

**Example: Calculate the Slope**
Calculate the slope of the line passing through the points (1, 2) and (3, 4).

**Solution:**
Using the slope formula:
$$m = \frac{4 - 2}{3 - 1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$$

### 9. Graphing Algebraic Equations

Plot linear equations using Matplotlib.

**Example: Plot a Linear Equation**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 400)
y = 2 * x + 3

plt.plot(x, y, label='y = 2x + 3')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Graph of y = 2x + 3')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
